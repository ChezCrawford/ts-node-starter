# Node.js TypeScript Starter Project

As I continue to explore integrating TypeScript in some small Node.js projects, this
project will contain "Best Practices" and other information for setting up a project.

This project currently demonstrates the following items:
* The most basic TypeScript project in Node.js ever.
* Importing a Node.js API module into a TypeScript file.

## Getting Started

Getting started is as simple as running the following commands:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
